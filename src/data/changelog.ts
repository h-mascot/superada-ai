      "Gateway/logging: expand leading `~` in `logging.file` before creating the file logger, preventing startup crash loops for home-relative log paths. Fixes #73587.",
      "Channels/CLI: keep `openclaw channels list --json` usable when provider usage fetching fails, and report per-provider usage errors without aborting the channel list. Refs #67595.",
      "Doctor/plugins: do not treat `plugins.allow` entries as configured plugins during missing-plugin repair, so restrictive allowlists no longer install allowed-but-unused plugins. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Agents/messaging: deliver distinct final commentary after same-target `message` tool sends while still deduping text/media already sent by the tool, so short closing remarks are no longer silently dropped. Fixes #76915. Thanks @hclsys.",
      "Agents/messaging: preserve string thread IDs when matching message-tool reply dedupe routes, avoiding precision loss on numeric-looking topic IDs before channel plugin comparison. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Channels/streaming: honor `agents.defaults.toolProgressDetail: \"raw\"` in Slack, Discord, Telegram, Matrix, and Microsoft Teams progress drafts, so tool-start lines include raw command/detail output when debugging. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Channels/streaming: strip unmatched inline-code backticks from compacted raw progress draft lines, avoiding stray markdown markers after long command details are shortened. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Discord/Slack/Mattermost: align draft preview tool-progress config help with the runtime behavior that hides interim tool updates when `streaming.preview.toolProgress` is false. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Feishu: use the shared channel progress formatter for streaming-card tool status lines, including raw command/detail output and message-tool filtering. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Mattermost: use the shared progress draft formatter for tool status previews, including raw command/detail output when `agents.defaults.toolProgressDetail: \"raw\"` is enabled. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Mattermost: suppress standalone default tool-progress messages while draft previews are active, including when draft tool lines are disabled. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Telegram: deliver button-only interactive replies by sending the shared fallback button-label text with the inline keyboard instead of dropping the reply as empty. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "OpenAI Codex: honor `auth.order.openai-codex` when starting app-server clients without an explicit auth profile, so status/model probes and implicit startup use the configured Codex account instead of falling back to the default profile. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "OpenAI Codex: let SSRF-guarded provider requests inherit OpenClaw's undici IPv4/IPv6 fallback policy, so ChatGPT-backed Codex runs recover on IPv4-working hosts when DNS still returns unreachable IPv6 addresses. Fixes #76857. Thanks @jplavoiemtl and @SymbolStar.",
      "Plugin updates: do not short-circuit trusted official npm updates as unchanged when the default/latest spec still resolves to an already-installed prerelease that the installer should replace with a stable fallback. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Plugin updates: clean stale bundled load paths for already-externalized npm installs whose legacy install record only preserved the resolved package name. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Plugin tools: keep auth-unavailable optional tools hidden even when another default tool from the same plugin is available and `tools.alsoAllow` names the optional tool. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Realtime transcription: report socket closes before provider readiness as closed-before-ready failures instead of mislabeling them as connection timeouts for OpenAI, xAI, and Deepgram streaming transcription. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "OpenAI/Google Meet: fail realtime voice connection attempts when the socket closes before `session.updated`, avoiding stuck Meet joins waiting on a bridge that never became ready. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Google Meet: avoid treating repeated participant words as multiple assistant-overlap matches when suppressing realtime echo transcripts. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Google Meet: make `mode: \"agent\"` the default Chrome talk-back path, using realtime transcription for input and regular OpenClaw TTS for speech output, while keeping direct realtime voice answers available as `mode: \"bidi\"` and accepting `mode: \"realtime\"` as an agent-mode compatibility alias.",
      "Codex harness: keep `codex_app_server.*` telemetry publication owned by the harness instead of republishing the same callback event from core runners. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Slack/Discord: suppress standalone tool-progress chatter when partial preview streaming has `streaming.preview.toolProgress: false`, matching the documented quiet-preview behavior. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Matrix: bind native approval reaction targets before publishing option reactions, so fast approver reactions on threaded prompts are not dropped while the approval handler finishes setup. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Google Meet: make realtime talk-back agent-driven by default with `realtime.strategy: \"agent\"`, keep the previous direct bidirectional model behavior available as `realtime.strategy: \"bidi\"`, route the Meet tab speaker output to `BlackHole 2ch` automatically for local Chrome realtime joins, coalesce nearby speech transcript fragments before consulting the agent, and avoid cutting off agent speech from server VAD or stale playback pipe errors.",
      "Google Meet: suppress queued assistant playback and assistant-like transcript echoes from the realtime input path, so the meeting does not hear the agent's own speech as a new user turn and loop or cut itself off.",
      "Google Meet: keep Chrome realtime transport tests hermetic on Linux prerelease shards while preserving the macOS-only runtime guard. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "QA/Matrix: let the live tool-progress preview and error checks verify progress replacement events without depending on the preview saying `Working`, `tool: read`, an unlabelled/pathless `read from`, or the original draft root being observed. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "QA/Matrix: keep the target=both approval scenario focused on channel and DM metadata delivery by resolving the accepted approval through the gateway after both Matrix events are observed. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "QA/Matrix: wait for live approval reactions to echo before starting the threaded approval decision timeout. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "QA/Matrix: reuse the primed driver sync stream when confirming approval reaction echoes, avoiding missed self-reactions in live release runs. Thanks @vincentkoc.",
      "Channels/WhatsApp: apply the shared group/channel visible-reply mode during inbound dispatch so group replies stay message-tool-only by default without overriding direct-chat harness defaults. Refs #75178 and #67394. Thanks @scoootscooob.",
      "Plugins/Codex: preserve Codex-native OAuth routing for `/codex bind` app-server turns so bound sessions keep the selected Codex auth profile instead of falling back to public OpenAI credentials. (#76714) Thanks @keshavbotagent.",
      "Telegram: keep status checks pointed at the active chat so asking for the current session no longer reports an old direct-message conversation. (#76708) Thanks @amknight.",
      "Gateway/install: prefer supported system Node over nvm/fnm/volta/asdf/mise when regenerating managed gateway services, so `gateway install --force` no longer recreates service definitions that doctor immediately flags as version-manager-backed. Fixes #76339. Thanks @brokemac79 and @BunsDev.",
      "Google Chat: normalize Google auth certificate response headers before google-auth-library reads cache-control, so inbound webhook auth no longer rejects with `res?.headers.get is not a function`. Fixes #76880. Thanks @donbowman.",
      "WhatsApp: route terminal login QR output through the active runtime for initial and restart sockets, so `openclaw channels login --channel whatsapp` does not lose the QR behind direct stdout writes. Fixes #76213. Thanks @dougvk.",
      "Proxy/debugging: disable debug proxy direct upstream forwarding for proxy requests and CONNECT tunnels while managed proxy mode is active unless `OPENCLAW_DEBUG_PROXY_ALLOW_DIRECT_CONNECT_WITH_MANAGED_PROXY=1` is explicitly set for approved local diagnostics. Thanks @jesse-merhi and @mjamiv.",
      "Direct APNs: route direct HTTP/2 delivery through the active managed proxy with redacted proxy diagnostics, so push requests honor configured egress controls and `openclaw proxy validate --apns-reachable` can prove APNs is reachable through the proxy before deployment. (#74905) Thanks @jesse-merhi.",
      "Agents/subagents: detect prefix-only completion announce replies and fall back to the captured child result so requester chats no longer lose most of long sub-agent reports silently. Fixes #76412. Thanks @inxaos and @davemorin.",
      "TUI: replace the stale-response watchdog notice with plain user-facing copy so stalled replies no longer surface backend or streaming internals. (#77120) Thanks @davemorin.",
      "Security/Windows: validate `SystemRoot`/`WINDIR` env values through the Windows install-root validator and add them to the dangerous-host-env policy when resolving `icacls.exe`/`whoami.exe` for `openclaw security audit`, so workspace `.env` overrides and bare command names cannot redirect Windows ACL helpers to attacker-controlled binaries. (#74458) Thanks @mmaps.",
      "Security/Windows: pin Windows registry-probe `reg.exe` resolution to the canonical Windows install root in install-root probing, so `SystemRoot`/`WINDIR` env overrides cannot redirect registry queries during Windows host detection. (#74454) Thanks @mmaps.",
      "QQBot: preserve the framework command authorization decision when converting framework command contexts into engine slash command contexts, so downstream slash handlers see `commandAuthorized` matching the channel's resolved `isAuthorizedSender` instead of a hardcoded `true`. (#77453) Thanks @drobison00.",
      "Security/Windows: block `LOCALAPPDATA` from workspace `.env` and resolve Windows update-flow portable Git path prepends from the trusted process-local `LOCALAPPDATA` only, so workspace-supplied values cannot redirect `git` discovery during `openclaw update`. (#77470) Thanks @drobison00.",
      "Browser/SSRF: enforce the existing current-tab URL navigation policy before tab-scoped debug, export, and read routes (console, page errors, network requests, trace start/stop, response body, screenshot, snapshot, storage, etc.) collect from an already-selected tab, so blocked tabs return a policy error instead of being read first and redacted only at response time. (#75731) Thanks @eleqtrizit.",
      "Security/Windows: route the `.cmd`/`.bat` process wrapper through the shared Windows install-root resolver instead of `process.env.ComSpec`, so workspace dotenv-blocked `SystemRoot`/`WINDIR` overrides and unsafe values like UNC paths or path-lists cannot redirect `cmd.exe` selection on Windows. (#77472) Thanks @drobison00.",
      "Agents/bootstrap: honor `BOOTSTRAP.md` content injected by `agent:bootstrap` hooks when deciding whether bootstrap is pending, so hook-provided required setup instructions are included in the system prompt. (#77501) Thanks @ificator."
